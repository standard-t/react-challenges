This project is a front-end web application built with HTML, React.js, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and TypeScript, designed to replicate the core functionality of the popular academic management platform Canvas. The app currently focuses on the user interface (UI) for managing courses, assignments, grades, and student profiles, providing a responsive and intuitive design for both students and instructors.

<strong> Key Features (UI): </strong> <br/>
- Course navigation including modules, assignments, people <br/>
- Assignment submission and creation interface <br/>
- User profile management UI <br/>
- Responsive and modern design with Bootstrap <br/>
  
<strong> Future Development: </strong> <br/>
In the future, I will be implementing the back-end of the application using MongoDB, JavaScript, and APIs to enable real-time data storage, retrieval, and user authentication. The goal is to create a fully functional academic management platform with seamless integration between front-end and back-end systems.
<br/> <br/>
This project demonstrates the use of React.js and TypeScript for dynamic front-end development, while setting the stage for a complete full-stack solution.
